This project is about to build Regression Model to predict the selling price of copper and to build Classification Model to predict the leads conversion.

**Copper - A Brief Overview**

Copper is a reddish-brown metal known for its high electrical and thermal conductivity.
It is one of the oldest metals used by humans, with historical evidence dating back thousands of years. Copper is malleable, ductile, and resistant to corrosion, making it useful in various industries, especially in electrical wiring, plumbing, and electronics.
Due to its excellent conductivity, copper is a critical component in power generation and transmission systems.
It is also used in alloys like bronze (copper and tin) and brass (copper and zinc) for various mechanical and aesthetic applications.
Copper is widely mined across the world, with major producers including Chile, the U.S., and Peru.
